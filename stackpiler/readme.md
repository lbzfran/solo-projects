# Goals
Create a turing complete, stack based programming language in c.


# Features
The program will be stored in a stack array, where execution will be done
for each element in the array.
Keywords:
PUSH: pushes a value.
POP : sends the top value to the output.
ADD : takes the top two (last two) values, adds them, and pushes the result.
SUB : takes the top two values, subtracts them, and pushes the result.
MUL : takes the top two values, multiplies them, and pushes the result.
