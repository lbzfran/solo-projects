# Solo Projects
Small projects I have been working on.

## Urban Scraper
A dictionary script that scrapes for definitions from Urban Dictionary. Can be called with or without arguments.

Running without arguments will open an interactive terminal where the user can write the words they want to define.

`python main.py`

Running with arguments defines the words given and passes them to stdout.

`python main.py word1 word2 ...`


## Card Game
A small card game based on the mechanics of a Shin Megami Tensei game. Currently incomplete.
