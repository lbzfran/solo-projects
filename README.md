# Solo Projects
Small projects I have been working on.

## Urban Scraper
A dictionary script that scrapes for definitions from Urban Dictionary. Can be called with or without arguments.

Running without arguments will open an interactive terminal where the user can write the words they want to define.

`python uscrape.py`

Running with arguments defines the words given and passes them to stdout.

`python uscrape.py word1 word2 ...`

## Card Game
A small card game based on the mechanics of a Shin Megami Tensei game. Currently incomplete.

## File Type Report
Reports by file extension the count and total byte size in HTML/XML.

Needs to be compiled in Visual Studio.
